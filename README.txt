Basic Java implementation of the Snake Game.
A user controls a snake moving in real time around a 10x10 grid collecting apples.
Each apple collected increases the size of the snake by one.
If the snake runs into its own tail or a wall, the player loses.

Implementation details:
    Grid is a 2D array of TETiles. The location of the snake's body is tracked in a queue data structure
